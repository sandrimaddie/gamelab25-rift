# RIFT - Game Project

In this fast-paced 2v2 (1v1 available) multiplayer game, teams race to collect resources, craft powerful magical orbs, and sacrifice them to summon a mighty god. Strategy and teamwork are key as you outmaneuver your opponents, using bombs to disrupt their progress and unleash a variety of chaotic effects to tilt the battlefield in your favor.

Every match is packed with frantic action, clever plays, and magical mayhem. Whether you're helping your partner gather items or scheming to sabotage the enemy, each round offers a unique and thrilling experience.

**Summon your god first to claim victory and eternal bragging rights!**
